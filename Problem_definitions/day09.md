# Day 9: Recursion

See the original assignment on 
[Day 9: Recursion | HackerRank
](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/problem).

## Objective
Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion. 

## Task
Complete the factorial function. Be sure to use recursion.

Factorial has the following parameter:

- int `n`: an integer

##### Returns
- int: the factorial of `n`

> **Note:**  If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, 
> you will get a score of 0.

##### Input Format
A single integer, `n` (the argument to pass to factorial).

##### Constraints
- $2 \leq n \leq 12$
- the code must contain a recursive function named factorial.

##### Output Format
A single integer, which is  the factorial of `n`.
###### Sample Input 
```
3
```

###### Sample Output 
```
6
```
